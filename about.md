I am a Ph.D. researcher in Biomedical Engineering at the University at Buffalo, specializing in RF instrumentation, electromagnetic simulations, and MRI system development. With over four years of experience designing RF resonators, including dipoles, LC loops, microstrip transmission lines, and phased arrays, I bring a systems-level understanding of medical imaging hardware.

I'm passionate about combining theory and hands-on engineering to build innovative imaging solutions and have presented at ISMRM conferences and published in top-tier journals.

Feel free to explore my work!
