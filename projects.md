### Superconducting and Low-Temperature RF Coil Evaluation at 70 mT
- Designed multi-turn LC loops and solenoidal coils for very-low-field MRI.
- Achieved SNR gains of up to 45% under superconducting conditions.
- Simulations performed in CST and HFSS, using B1+ normalization and ROI-based SNR analysis.

### High-Field Dipole Array Design for Extremity Imaging at 7T
- Built end-coated half-wave dipole arrays for knee and foot imaging.
- Applied dielectric coatings to optimize field uniformity and reduce SAR.

### Birdcage and Phased Array Coils for 70 mT Clinical Imaging (Internship @ Neuro42)
- Developed 16-leg birdcage coils and validated them using VNA and lab setups.
- Led integration for a prototype low-field MR coil system submitted for patent.
